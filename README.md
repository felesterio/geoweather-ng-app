MR. SPEH:

We had a backlog of stuff we were not able to get to that we would like you to know about.

Need more form validation (event sub types need required field restriction)

Weird Zooming on Map UI

One can increment the validation score more than once

We had a login system not implemented in this iteration

All Spring/Backend we are happy with. Nothing we want to change there.

Middleware / realtime updating was on our back log
